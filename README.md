# Task Distribution System with Python and Tkinter UI

## Project Overview

This project addresses the task of "Task Distribution among Control Nodes." The program takes as input an adjacency matrix of a graph representing distances or costs. The task solution involves implementing the "Branch and Bound" method. The outcome of the task is the construction of a decision tree that finds the optimal (minimum) distance or cost.

## Functionality

- **Input:**
  - The user inputs an adjacency matrix representing distances or costs in the graph.

- **Solution Method:**
  - The program utilizes the "Branch and Bound" method to solve the task.

- **Output:**
  - The result is a decision tree that identifies the optimal (minimum) distance or cost.

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Python)
- The backend is implemented in Python, handling the logic for solving the task using the "Branch and Bound" method.

### User Interface (Tkinter)
- The user interface is implemented using the Tkinter framework, providing an intuitive interface for users to input data and visualize the solution process.

## Conclusion

By combining the power of Python for the backend and Tkinter for the user interface, this project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution to the "Task Distribution among Control Nodes" problem. The "Branch and Bound" method is employed to ensure the identification of optimal distances or costs.
